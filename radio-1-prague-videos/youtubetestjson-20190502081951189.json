Then they had a song that went viral because of the #LaChonaChallenge, which, like Drake's challenge, had people step out of their cars, do a few dance steps, and get back in the car. It became a massive sensation, and Los Tucanes de Tijuana were invited to perform at the 2019 Coachella Festival in the California desert. Here are two clips: The first a \"best of\" of the #LaChonaCallenge, and the second of their performance of \"La Chona\" at Coachella.</p><p><br></p><p>SCROLL DOWN TO VIEW \"LA CHONA CHALLENGE\" AND \"LA CHONA (LIVE AT COACHELLA)\"</p>","image":{"srcmain":"uploads/youtubetestjson-20190502081951189/los-tucanes.jpg","srcphone":"uploads/youtubetestjson-20190502081951189/los-tucanes-640x480.jpg","srcmedium":"uploads/youtubetestjson-20190502081951189/los-tucanes-1024x768.jpg"},"offset":{"left":false,"centre":false,"right":false,"custom":false,"value":"50"},"nav_title":""}},{"youtube":{"id":"6","nav_title":"La Chona Challenge","youtube_id":"1deW3cZxYmg","autoAdvance":"on"}},{"youtube":{"id":"7","nav_title":"Los Tucanes De Tijuana - La Chona (Live at Coachella)","youtube_id":"MAqlr7_dZFY","autoAdvance":"on"}},{"textcentred":{"nav_title":"","suppress":"on","id":"8","title":"<p>Rosalia, J.
